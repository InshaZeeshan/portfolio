                <h2>Software Engineering Intern</h2>
                <p>As a Software Engineering intern at Megasoft Information System Pvt Ltd, Lucknow, I spent six weeks diving into the world of coding. My internship period was from 1st July 2023 and lasted till 14th August 2023. With the guidance of Mr. Deepak Poddar, the company's CTO, I got hands-on experience in CSharp and the .NET framework. Using the knowledge gained from this training, I built a Windows Notepad clone. <br> <br>

                    Later on, I moved into full-stack development. That's where I created a Student Registration Form using front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the look and feel, and PHP for the behind-the-scenes database handling. I used Xampp's PHP development environment and phpMyAdmin localhost server, to handle student records smoothly. To know more about my projects, please navigate to the Projects section of my portfolio.
                    <br><br>
                    In my first-ever step in the software industry, this internship at Megasoft Information System wasn't just about coding- it turned out to be a motivational journey that expanded my knowledge. I learned not only the technical side but also how to put my best foot forward in every aspect, whether it was polishing my social skills or refining my technical abilities. This experience set the stage for a promising start in my software engineering career, leaving me eager to take on new challenges and keep growing.</p>
